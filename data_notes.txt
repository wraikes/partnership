NOTES FOR TEAM:

- All directory and file names should omit spaces.  Underscores is a recommended alternative.
  - For example: "Inquisit Merged Data" -> "Inquisit_Merged_Data"


NOTES TO SELF:

- Use indices for externalID and internalID
- Drop extra blank rows in datafiles (not sure why xls to csv keeps them).
- Test all data shapes and make sure nothing is omitted.
- Create a sheet documenting the different label names.
- Need to know which columns can be included only once
